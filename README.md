# Javascript Template

#### This is a starter template for Epicodus JS classes. Current as of August 1, 2016

#### By Dylan Barnard and Matthew Giem

## Description

This repository contains the following folders and files.  They can be used to support a basic project template for the beginning of each of your projects.

* gulpfile.js
* package.json
* index.html with bootstrap and jquery linked
* .gitignore
* .build folder

## Setup/Installation Requirements

To create your own template repository on github

* Clone the github repository using the git clone command from /Desktop
* Create a new repository on github to keep your template
* Using git remote add pair the clone on your desktop with your new repository
* Add, commit, and push, and then you'll have your own copy of the template to do with as you wish

To install this repository into a new project each time, first

* Clone the github repository using the git clone command from /Desktop
* Create a new folder in the Desktop with your project name
* Copy and paste the entire contents of the cloned /javascript-template into your new folder (this should not include the .pairs file)
* Move into your new folder and initialize git as normal
* ``` $ npm install ``` to pull dependencies listed in package.json
* Congrats! You now have a new repo based on this template

Some **DONT'S**

* Don't just rename the cloned git repository - that will mess up future commits.  Do the copy/paste

## Known Bugs

None.  But we haven't really tested much, so if you find anything, let us know and we'll fix it and update the repo.
